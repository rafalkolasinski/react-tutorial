React tutorial repo - for learning purposes only.

# Commands
* `npm install` - to install the dependencies
* `npm start` - to run the server & app via webpack-dev-server

# Notes
In the first version babel was required - currently, as all of the browsers support ES2016/ES6, there's no need.
But still - it's installed to dev dependencies for legacy browsers support.
